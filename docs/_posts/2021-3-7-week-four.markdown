This week I caught up with some of the progress I missed in the previous week's work as well as worked on some of the questions I had last week.

Thanks to the Youtube link, I was able to tilemap all my initial designs for the game. Using an updated version of the player object I created, I was able to create a somewhat playable prototype of the game. I was also able to play around with the camera so it'll follow the player around better than previously.

I was also able to add in the beginnings of the townfolk within the game, under the name enemy. Currently, all they do is "patrol" but I plan to have them do damage to the player this week. I also added the coin sprite into  some levels to see the difficulty in obtaining them and so far they seem manageable.

For this week, I will need to add in the older second player as well as implement the save feature for both of those two characters to make that switch happen, as well as collect how many coins the player collected / how many enemies they destroyed.
