This is the final week of senior project and the last update before the semester ends. The final weeksin general mainly focused on sprites for the game 
as well as implementations for the narrative of the story. For the latter, the narrative was placed in the story but from the feedback received by 
others, the story isn't completely clear to the player who goes in without any information. Part of it is intentional, given that I do like stories that
allow the player to interpret the story in their own way, but the story was difficult to follow with the information provided in the game.

Future iterations will address that, plus add audio as that was another key portion missing in the final game.
