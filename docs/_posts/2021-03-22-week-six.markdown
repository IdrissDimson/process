This week, I was not able to do much work with the Unity project since I had some midterm deadlines due for other classes.
However, I spent the week working on how I want to narrative to be told within the game. I've decided on having the dialogue be similar to  *Getting Over It*
and will just have myself recording all the dialouge to the game this week, while finalizing all the character abilities this week  as well.

In addition, I will be creating a mood board for the style in the game.
