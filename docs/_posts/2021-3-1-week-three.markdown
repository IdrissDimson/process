This week I ended slightly behind where I wanted to be. 
I was behind on other class work as well as it took me longer than I expected to pick up Unity2D, it was a little weird only working with x and y in Unity. 

Luckily, I found a Youtube playlist that answered all the questions that I had with Unity2D as well as have good info on how I can add animation later, and tilemapping for quick level making.

In addition, I was also able to discover how to switch between scenes I made in Unity: <https://gamedevbeginner.com/how-to-load-a-new-scene-in-unity-with-a-loading-screen/>. I was able to quickly add that in my project and now I'm beginning to have a functioning project. 

To catch up on lost progress, for this week, I plan to find some sample tilemap art to allow for me to use the tilemapping in Unity to hopefully make all the levels I designed. There should be roughly "8" levels (16 since you'll be going through all 8 again).

In addition, I would need to figure out how to do the character switch once the rod is obtained by the player. I found the foundation to my answer in this stack overflow response: <https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/110958/what-is-the-proper-way-to-handle-data-between-scenes>. Once the switch can happen, the pre-alpha is completed and I can test out the game mechanics with other people to see what refinements I'll need to complete before the alpha build.
