This week, I was able to finalize the character abilities. The older character's jump was changed to three jumps as I found the original double jump made traversing through the levels very limiting and I wanted to encourage some more exploration. How the older character will manage having a third jump in his ability is that the scepter he acquires allows him to propel himself, acting as a third jump. I plan to use the character animation to better convey that ability.

For the art style, I started a mood board on Pinterest: <https://pin.it/5q3zpbv>

I have always admired the art style of games such as Monument Valley and Alto's Adventure, and I always thought the art style for both of those games would translate really well to a platformer. Since those games are respectively puzzle and endless runner games, I think it would be pretty unique for a 2D platformer. 

This week, I want to start the first sketches on both the character design/background designs. I also will be taking feedback on how to handle voice over within my game so I can include exposition into the story, while also recuiting some people to record some voiceover for my project as well. I hope to start adding that in this week as well.
